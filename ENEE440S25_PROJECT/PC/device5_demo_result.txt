# Test Script - Device 5 ADC
#
# Note: For ADC value reporting, connect a variable voltage source to PA0.
# For threshold tests, connect PA0 to GND, 3.3V, or a specific voltage as prompted.
# For EXTI1 tests, ensure PA1 can be triggered by connecting it to 3.3V.
# An oscilloscope or multimeter on PA0 can help verify input voltages.
