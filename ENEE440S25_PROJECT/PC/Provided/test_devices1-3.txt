# 	Comment lines in the script are printed to the system console but ignored by the program.
# 	Lines that aren't comments are sent as strings to the serial port when the user hits 'Enter'.
#   Demonstrations of some commands follow: 
#
# device1, the 'green LED' command demonstration
# Command ':0100FF' initializes the green LED device. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0100FF
#":0101FE" turns it on. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0101FE
#":0104FB" reports its state. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0104FB
#":0102FD" turns it off. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0102FD
#":0103FFFF0000FE" starts a blinking task. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0103FFFF0000FE
#":0104FB" reports its instantaneous state. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0104FB
#":0105FA" installs 'skip' task and ends blinking. Hit 'Enter' to send the command 
:0105FA
# device1 demo is done.
# 
# device2, the 'blue Button' inter-device command demo
#":0200FE" initializes PC13 for input from blue Button
:0200FE
#":0201FD" sends a command to device1 to turn green LED 'ON'
:0201FD
#":0202FC" sends a command to device1 to turn green LED 'OFF'
:0202FC
#":0203FB" starts a task which monitors blue Button and send commands to device1 to turns green LED 'On' 'OFF'
:0203FB
#":0204FA" stops the blue Button monitor task
:0204FA
# device2 demo is done. 
#
# device3 demo, a test of sending inter-device commands
#":03000DF0000000" starts a task which oscillates every 0x0000F00D task cycles and sends an ON or OFF command to device1
:03000DF0000000
#":0301FC" pauses device3 commands being sent to device1
:0301FC
#":0302FB" resumes device3 commands to device1
:0302FB
#":0303FA" is a nop which is ignored (better demo would be to change frequency of oscillation)
:0303FA
#":0301FC" again pauses device3 so no more commands will be sent to device1
:0301FC
# device3 demo is done
#
# Testing is ended -- there are no more commands to demonstrate. Hit 'Enter' to quit
# Note : any blank lines in the test script _after_ this point will be interpreted as commands 
#	and testterm will send a sequence of messages "0 bytes received." at 10 second intervals,
#	one for each blank line
